# unsupervised-bias-detection 
## WORK IN PROGRESS

Sparse unsupervised clustering using non-negative kernel regression in the feature space for targeted and general identification of biases in Image Datasets. This work also proposes a performance-based feature sampling scheme to reduce the impact of bias groups in image classes when fine-tuning.
